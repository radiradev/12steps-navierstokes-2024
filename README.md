# 12 Steps to Navier Stokes with Marimo
Check out the links for each implementation to run this interactive code directly in the browser with Marimo!

Implementations based on the [CFD Python: 12 Steps to Navier-Stokes](https://lorenabarba.com/blog/cfd-python-12-steps-to-navier-stokes/) course by Lorena Barba with [`Marimo`](https://marimo.io/).

The code is rewritten in a vectorized approach (i.e no looping through spatial coordinates). I am also utilizing the interactivity provided by `marimo` to aid to the exploration of the behaviour of the differential equations and integration schemes.

## 1D Advection

For a more in depth discussion of the advection equation I highly recommend the video from the MIT course [Introduction to Computational Thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb-iUwXI78A&t=2063s).
