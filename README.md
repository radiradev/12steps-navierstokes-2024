# 12 Steps to Navier Stokes with Marimo
Reimplementation of [CFD Python: 12 Steps to Navier-Stokes](https://lorenabarba.com/blog/cfd-python-12-steps-to-navier-stokes/) course by Lorena Barba with [`Marimo`](

The following is a refactor of the wonderful [CFD Python: 12 Steps to Navier-Stokes](https://lorenabarba.com/blog/cfd-python-12-steps-to-navier-stokes/) course by Lorena Barba. In this refactor of the lessons I am using a `numpy` first approach as this results in more easily readable code. I am also utilizing the interactivity provided by `marimo` to aid to the exploration of the behaviour of the differential equations and integration schemes.

## 1D Advection 
For a more in depth discussion of the advection equation I highly recommend the video from the MIT course [Introduction to Computational Thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb-iUwXI78A&t=2063s).

An interactive version (powered by Web Assembly) is available at [marimo.app](https://marimo.io/p/@linear-advection/notebook-puh4gd).
